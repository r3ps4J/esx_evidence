# esx_evidence
Evidence Locker inside Mission Row Armoury

## About this fork
I changed some *minor* things in this project.
Mainly so this plugin works great as an additon to my paid plugin **r3-evidence_storage**, which you can buy [here](https://discord.gg/bEWmBbg).

Here I will state the changes I made in this fork.
- I have no clue, I edited some stuff like the missing config options.
- Copy pasted the locales from esx_policejob which seemed to work.
- Fixed not being able to reopen the menu when still in the circle.
- Edited marker to the same marker as r3-evidence_storage to make them look cool and stuff.
- Removed all useless locales and changed some.

### Dependencies
You need esx, esx_addoninventory and esx_datastore.
